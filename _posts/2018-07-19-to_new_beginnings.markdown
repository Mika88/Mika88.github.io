So why did I start coding?
That's actually a good question..
You see, I'm not your typical computer wiz or tech enthusiast, I do use the computer for many things  (mainly googling random facts about random stuff), but I'm quite old school -- I was actually the last one among my friends to get a smart phone..

And then-  I got married to a programmer. :)
And then-  we relocated to the US. 
And then-  I pretty much had to figure my life out from scratch. 
Back home I was on my way to becoming a somatic therapist (yes, there is such a thing), 
and when we came here everything changed. 
Suddenly my future wasn't as clear anymore, and together with the fear and confusion it caused, 
it was also an amazing oportunity to rethink, and even rebuild my future. 

So now, at 30, I'm starting over. How terrifyingly exciting!
And I'm starting over with coding, which brings me back to the initial question... why coding?

Knowing me and knowing coding, my husband was always trying to convince me I should try it out, he was sure I will like it.  and a few months ago I finely did. And I did like it! ( guess I should listen to him more often..)

I love solving problems. I will not quite untill I've reached a solution, 
and three weeks into the Web Development course, it really menifests itself. 
Also, with a B.A in Linguistics and Psychology, I feel that the more I learn about programming the more I'm intrigued about these structures and how they come to life. Similarly to spoken languages, programming is all about connection and communication, and coming from the therapy world, I appretiate the importance of these concepts. 

I'm still a newbie in this field, but I already recognize the great potential programming holds in connecting people and ideas, and I must admit that being a part of this world excites me.
