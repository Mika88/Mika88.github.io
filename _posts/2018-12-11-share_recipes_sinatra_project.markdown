For my Sinatra app project I decided to create a recipes share app, where you can upload your own recipes and also see other user's recipes. 
I like to cook, and some of my friends are also into cooking, so I thought it would be nice to have an app where you could easily share recipes and get inspired by others. 

To use the app a user should sign up, or log in, if they're already signed up.
Once signed or logged in, the user is directed to the main page, which contains a list of all the recipes by the different users. 
Clicking on each recipe's name gets the user to the recipe's page which has all the information about the recipe, like ingredients, quantities and instructions. This page also contains the edit and delete buttons, but only the user who created the recipe can use them. 

One of the things thast really helped me during the project was to refer back (and forth)  to the last few labs in the Sinatra section. 
Also, using the ActiveRecord gem made things a lot easier than writing all those methods by myself. 

But, lets start in the beginning.. 
To start off with the app, I would suggest to watch at least the first few minutes of the 'Sinatra app from scratch' video. 
If you were like me, and a bit confused about the right structure of the app and getting an idea on where to start, this is very useful. 

Next I built the models, deciding on the right associations between them and creating the necessary tables.
After that I just played around with the models, making sure the associations work the way I expected them to. 
This practice was really helpful in understanding ActiveRecord better, especially when working with associations. 

Then, after making sure the basic framework is all set up, I would definitely suggest to run shotgun and just go step-by-step  and create the  different routes and requests in the controllers and the views files. Using the browser helped me to be more focused and make more sense of the structure and features I wanted my app to have.

Over all I really enjoyed working on this project, I feel that things are coming together and that I understand what I've learned a bit more.  I definitely felt more comfortable experimenting  with my code, which was a lot of fun.
